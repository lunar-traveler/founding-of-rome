Each young man was desiring to give a name to the new city and rule it. But because they were twins and the matter was not able to be decided by age, they made use of augury. Six vultures were seen by Remus first. Afterwards, twelve showed themselves to Romulus. Each one was hailed as king by his friends and kept demanding the kingdom. When, angry, they had seized arms, Remus fell in the fight.
In another version of the story, Remus, mocking his brother, jumped across the new walls of the city; thence he was killed by an angry Romulus, who also added these words: "Thus, henceforth, let whoever else shall jump over my walls die." Thus, Romulus alone obtained power. He called the founded city Rome from his own name.
He fortified the Palatine Hill first, on which he himself had been brought up. With the multitude having been called to a council, he gave laws. He also took up symbols of power, a curule chair and a toga praetexta, and twelve lictors. He opened a sanctuary on the Capitoline Hill, to where many from neighboring peoples fled. He also created one hundred senators, who were called fathers for the sake of honor.
