This is an adaption of the traditional stories about the founding of Rome. I wanted to include both versions, the one where Remus jumped over the city wall and the one where they went to war due to confusing omens. However, I also wanted to give freedom to the player in terms of meaningful choices, so that their choices affect the outcome of the story. Chance also comes into play in my adaptation. Like in Baulder's Gate 3, though very rudimentary, there are "skill checks" that introduce variety when replaying. This is to not lock you into a specific ending, but give just enough variations that it balances well with meaningful choices.
