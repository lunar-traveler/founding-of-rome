Lavinia reigned from that time, until Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, grew up. Then he, on account of the overflowing multitude of Lavinium, left the city to his mother; he himself founded another new city at the foot of the Alban mountain, which was called Alba Longa. Many kings after Ascanius held the Alban power. A certain one of these, whose name was Proca, had two sons, Numitor and Amulius. He left the kingdom to Numitor, who was the elder. However, with the brother having been driven out, Amulius reigned. He killed the son of his brother; he chose his brother's daughter, Rhea Silvia, through the pretense of honor as a priestess of Vesta.
